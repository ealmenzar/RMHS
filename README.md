## Original Study: "Not So Innocent: Does Seeing One’s Own Capability for Wrongdoing Predict Forgiveness?"

This work is an attempted reproduction of study 7 of the paper "Not So Innocent:  Does Seeing One’s Own Capability for Wrongdoing Predict Forgiveness?" The authors hypothesized that people are more willing to forgive an offender if they consider their own personal capability of committing a similar offense. They also proposed that men's vengefulness in particular can be reduced in this way.

We extended the study by analyzing if the perceived severity of the offense affected the willingness to forgive, vengefulness, empathy or personal capability of the subject.
We also measured if the subjects perceived the severity of the offense differently after considering their personal capability.

We were unable to reproduce any of the main hypotheses of the original paper and the perceived severity of the offense didn't change significantly by considering the personal capability either.

However, we were able to show that the perceived severity of the offense correlates negatively with the willingness to forgive, personal capability and empathy, as well as positively with vengefulness.
